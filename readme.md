Hi! I'm LemonKat!

I'm a high school student who's into math, CS, and engineering. I also like reading, sailing, exploring public transit, simulating space flight, and diving deep into life's absurdities.

This account has my personal projects from middle school as well as high school. As you can see, the projects are quite diverse. Sometimes the goal was to solve a problem, sometimes the goal was to learn a new technique/tool, sometimes I was just messing around to see what I could make happen. These include my early coding projects which may not be up to formatting standards, and contain projects in various stages of completion and expansion.

Hit me up if you have any questions!

__My technical skills__:  
Python, Java, TensorFlow, OpenAI/ChatGPT APIs, TF-Agents (DQN), NumPy, SciPy, MatPlotLib, ML, LLMs, RL

__Brief descriptions of some of my projects__:
1. [llm_experiments](https://github.com/lemonkat/llm_experiments)  
   use multiple LLM agents via APIs to emulate social interactions and test character memories
   
2. [cfd_sailing_sim](https://github.com/lemonkat/cfd_sailing_sim)  
   implements the Navier–Stokes partial differential equations for computational fluid dynamics to simulate the movement of a sailboat through water and air

3. [bovine_borders_public](https://github.com/lemonkat/bovine_borders_public)  
   software battlebot contest we ran at our school, includes an AI bot trained using reinforcement learning

4. [DNN_orbit](https://github.com/lemonkat/DNN_orbit)  
   noise-robust ML model to approximate the n-body problem in physics in order to predict satellite trajectories in low-earth orbit

5. [lemonkats_cursed_code_emporium](https://github.com/lemonkat/lemonkats_cursed_code_emporium)  
    hodge podge of silly and useless but nonetheless interesting code

6. reinforcement learning walking robot [not yet uploaded]  
   simulated autonomous delivery robot trained using reinforcement learning

7. [quorum_sensing](https://github.com/lemonkat/quorum_sensing)  
   simulate the spontaneous evolution of quorum sensing communications among bacteria cells

8. [flea_binary](https://github.com/lemonkat/flea_binary)  
   cellular automaton that creates logic gates that are combined to form an expandable binary adder

9. [music_generator](https://github.com/lemonkat/music_generator)  
   algorithmically generate music in the style of classical piano, implementation using a transformer neural network in progress

10.  [monument_valley](https://github.com/lemonkat/monument_valley)  
    create the 'impossible' mazes of the visual puzzle game Monument Valley, in the style of M.C. Esher’s art

11. [citations](https://github.com/lemonkat/citations)  
    created a custom LISP-like programming language and used it to generate MLA-9 style citations
