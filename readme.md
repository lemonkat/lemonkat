### Hi! I'm LemonKat!
(he/him/his)

I'm a high school student who's into math, CS, and engineering. I also like reading, sailing, and generally diving deep into life's absurdities.  

This account has my personal projects from middle school as well as high school, as well as projects in various stages of completion, so some of the formatting in some of the projects might not work. 

Hit me up if you have any questions!

#### My Technical Skills:  
Python, Java, TensorFlow, OpenAI/ChatGPT APIs, TF-Agents (DQN), NumPy, SciPy, MatPlotLib, Machine Learning, Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning
